## Abstract

A Sankey chart, or Sankey diagram, is an effective way to visualize flows and relationships between different entities. This presentation covers generating Sankey diagrams using networkD3, plot_ly, and ggalluvial packages in R. Each package offers unique features: networkD3 provides clean, interactive diagrams with draggable nodes and tooltips, plot_ly offers highly customizable and interactive plots with advanced hover and zoom capabilities, and ggalluvial leverages the ggplot2 framework for extensive customization and static visualizations. We will demonstrate how to create Sankey charts using the ADAE dataset to analyze treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by system organ class
(SOC) and preferred term (PT) with maximum severity. This comparison highlights the differences in appearance, interaction, and customization options among the three packages, providing a comprehensive guide for generating and interpreting Sankey diagrams in various contexts.
